        "1. **MNIST Dataset**: The MNIST dataset is a popular benchmark dataset in the field of machine learning. It consists of a collection of handwritten digits (0-9) that are commonly used for training and evaluating classification algorithms. Each image in the dataset is a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **`datasets` module**: The `datasets` module is part of the scikit-learn library (`sklearn`). It provides various datasets for practicing and testing machine learning algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **`load_digits()` function**: `load_digits()` is a function provided by the `datasets` module. When called, it loads the MNIST digits dataset and returns it as a dictionary-like object.\n",

        "4. **Returned object**: The `load_digits()` function returns an object with the following attributes:\n",
        "   - `data`: A 2D array representing the pixel values of each image in the dataset. Each row of the array corresponds to a flattened 8x8 image (64 pixels).\n",
        "   - `target`: An array of the corresponding labels or target values for each image. Each value in the array represents the digit (0-9) associated with the corresponding image.\n",
        "   - `images`: A 3D array of shape (n_samples, 8, 8) containing the original images in their original 8x8 shape.\n",

        "\n",
        "In your code snippet, the `mnist` variable is assigned the dictionary-like object returned by `datasets.load_digits()`. By accessing the attributes of this object, you can access the input data (`mnist.data`), target values (`mnist.target`), original images (`mnist.images`), and dataset description (`mnist.DESCR`).\n",

        "   - `mnist.target`: The target values or labels corresponding to each image in the MNIST dataset.\n",
        "   - `test_size=0.25`: The proportion of the dataset to be allocated for testing. Here, 25% of the data will be used for testing, and the remaining 75% will be used for training.\n",
        "   - `random_state=42`: The random state or seed used for randomizing the data splits. Setting a specific random state ensures reproducibility, meaning that the same splits will be obtained each time the code is run.\n",

        "3. **Returned Values**:\n",

        "By using `train_test_split` with the specified parameters, the MNIST dataset is divided into training and testing sets. The training set (`trainData` and `trainLabels`) will consist of 75% of the original data, while the testing set (`testData` and `testLabels`) will contain 25% of the data.

        "   - `model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=k)`: A new instance of the KNeighborsClassifier class is created, specifying the number of neighbors (`n_neighbors`) as the current value of `k`. This defines the k-Nearest Neighbor classifier model with the current number of neighbors.\n",

        "   - `score = model.score(valData, valLabels)`: The trained model is evaluated using the validation data (`valData`) and their corresponding labels (`valLabels`). The `score` represents the accuracy of the model on the validation set.\n",
        "   - `print(\"k=%d, accuracy=%.2f%%\" % (k, score * 100))`: The current value of `k` and its corresponding accuracy are printed to the console. The accuracy is formatted as a percentage using string formatting.\n",
        "   - `accuracies.append(score)`: The accuracy value is appended to the `accuracies` list, which can be used later for further analysis or visualization.\n",

        "The purpose of this code is to train and evaluate the k-Nearest Neighbor classifier with different values of `k`. By iterating over various values of `k` and evaluating the model's accuracy, the code helps in determining the optimal number of neighbors for the KNN algorithm on the given dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "Typically, the loop starts with a small value of `k` (such as 1) and gradually increases it to larger odd values. This allows for observing how the accuracy of the model changes with different numbers of neighbors and helps in selecting the best `k` value for the KNN classifier."
