In this project, I am using flutter_speech package that uses speech recognition to turn your speech into text.
It can recognize many languages like Arabic, English, Spanish, Italian, Russian and French.
I implement a simple user interface with a splash screen, an introduction screen and a home page. It is on the home page that your speech will be converted into usable and selectable text.
For more information, please visit the official link:

It shows you how to use it and provides you with the main functions and a detailed example for using this package.
